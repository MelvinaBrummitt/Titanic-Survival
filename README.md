# Titanic-Survival
Springboard capstone project
Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most notorious maritime disasters in history. With over 2,000 passengers and crew aboard, many lives were lost. This project aims to answer the key question: Can we predict which passengers were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster based on available demographic and socioeconomic data?

Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies passengers as survivors or non-survivors using features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. By analyzing these factors, the project seeks to uncover insights into the disparities that may have influenced survival rates during this tragedy.

Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about Titanic passengers, including:

	•	Demographics: Age, gender, etc.
	•	Ticket Details: Class, fare, cabin, etc.
	•	Survival Outcome: Whether the passenger survived or not.

Criteria for Success

Success in this project is measured by:

	•	Model Accuracy: Achieving at least 70% accuracy on the test set.
	•	Insights: Providing interpretable insights into the factors most significant in determining survival.
	•	Reproducibility: Ensuring that the process and results can be replicated by others using the same data and code.

Scope of Solution Space

The project involves exploring various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. Key tasks include:

	•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
	•	Feature Engineering: Creating new features like family size, titles from names, and cabin deck information.
	•	Modeling: Training and evaluating multiple models to find the best-performing one.
	•	Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Constraints

	•	Data Quality: The dataset contains missing values, especially in age and cabin details, which must be addressed.
	•	Imbalanced Classes: The number of survivors is significantly less than non-survivors, potentially affecting model predictions.
	•	Computational Resources: The project will utilize standard machine learning libraries and tools, with limited computational resources.

Stakeholders

	•	Data Science Community: Aimed at data scientists and students as a practical example of tackling classification problems.
	•	Historians and Researchers: Provides historical context and insights into survival disparities during the Titanic disaster.
	•	Educational Institutions: Can be used as a teaching tool for courses in data science, machine learning, and statistics.
